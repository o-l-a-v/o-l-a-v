### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like PowerShell.

Some of my favorite PowerShell learn and research projects I've been working on privatly are:

* [Using Winget from Intune](https://github.com/o-l-a-v/winget-intune-win32).
* [A script for keeping PowerShell modules from PowerShellGallery up to date](https://github.com/o-l-a-v/PowerShell-Projects/tree/master/PowerShellModulesUpdater).
