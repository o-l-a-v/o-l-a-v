### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like PowerShell.

I use it as much as possible in my work, but I also use it for some personal projects, like:

#### [winget-intune-win32](https://github.com/o-l-a-v/winget-intune-win32)

* Research into how to use Winget with Intune.

#### [PowerShellModulesUpdater](https://github.com/o-l-a-v/PowerShell-Projects/tree/master/PowerShellModulesUpdater).

* A script for keeping PowerShell modules from PowerShellGallery up to date.
